# RGS5-Gene

In this project, we analyzed gene expression profiles of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We found that the regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) might play a crucial role in initiation and progression of RCC, and it might be prognostic. We observed that a high expression level of RGS5 is associated with better survival months. Importantly, when the grade of tumor increases, the RGS5 expression level significantly decreases. Although there is no difference between expression level of RGS5 in male and female patients with primary tumors in the right kidney, among patients with primary tumors in the left kidney, females have a significantly higher RGS5 expression than males patients. Interestingly, we also observed a significant association between the high expression level of RGS5 and low serum calcium level and elevated white blood cells level.
